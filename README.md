# dhamma-sineru

How-to manuals for the Administration of Dhamma Sineru to distribute.

## Using this repository

1. Install Pandoc from https://pandoc.org/installing.html

2. Build the cleaning manuals:

```
./build.sh
```

Microsoft Word files will be written to `./output`.


## Making changes

Feel free to copy these documents and change them as you like for your local Vipassana centre! Please speak to the Dhamma Sineru Administration regarding changes to the canonical documents. Changes in Microsoft Word can be made and copied into this repository as a backup but the Word documents kept with the Administration are to be considered canonical for Dhamma Sineru.


## TODO

- Add images to residence doc
- Finish dormitories doc
- Page numbering?
