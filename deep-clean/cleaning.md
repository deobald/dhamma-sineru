# Dhamma Sineru Cleaning Manual


## Introduction

- goenkaji's cleaning comparisons work both ways: sweeping (x3) + mopping, a single piece of dirt on a dirty shirt vs. a clean shirt ... it can be a bit surprising how similar cleaning is to vipassana (ex. initial cleaning)
- Daily cleaning and per-course cleaning is like your daily practice. Deep Cleaning is more serious, like a serious meditation course. In the same way that Anapana and Vipassana lift very deep impurities to the surface, initial deep cleaning will make things dirtier at first.

- Always try to clean top to bottom.
- General cleaning order: sweep, dry dust surfaces top to bottom, sweep, scrub surfaces, sweep, mop.
- Always wear a dust mask while sweeping and dry dusting.

Tasks are organized by area and each area may take a different amount of time/effort. We have tried to estimate how many people can clean each area in one or two days but it may not be possible to clean them all. The Administration can keep a log of the most recently deep-cleaned areas. If you can only clean one or two areas, you can enter these in the log so the next cleaning team knows that they can deep clean something else. If there is no log, the next team can ask the Administration which area is best for them to clean.

Do not worry if you feel the time is limited or you are unable to finish. Because deep cleaning begins by making a bigger mess than was there to start with, just make sure you choose a small enough task that you can finish it before you leave. Even if only one residence is deep-cleaned in a service period, that one residence is that much better for the next service period.

## Residences

Each residence contains a balcony, a partition curtain, windows, two beds, two headboards, two shelves, two clothing rods, at least one toilet, and one bathroom.

1. Sweep up. Start with the balcony so you have a clean place to keep all your supplies. Next, sweep the shelves and nearby power outlet. Last, sweep bedroom/bathroom/toilet floors. Remove any leftover soap/toothpaste/detergent/bags/combs/etc from the room and dispose of it or save it, as you see fit.

2. Dry dust. Move all bedding, including the mattress, to one side of the room. Dry dust all surfaces on the empty side with a broom, duster, and/or cloth: Ceiling, electrical conduits, walls, windows, power outlets, headboard, bedframe (over and under). Sweep up all the dust this has knocked down to the floor. You may need to dry dust twice, first with a broom and then with a cloth. Dry dust the bathroom/toilet ceilings, walls, and windows. Sweep the floor after each dry dusting.

3. Scrub.

   (a) The bedroom. Add a small amount of phenol to a bucket and fill it halfway with water. Scrub windows, power outlets, headboard, curtain rods, and shelves using the scrub brush. Use the toothbrush for small surfaces such as the thin portions of the window pane. A mug with phenol water may help if you are moving around a lot. Tiled surfaces may have paint, wax, or other stains. If so, try to scratch the large stains off using the hard backside of the scrub brush, a green scratchy pad, or the wire brush. Do not use the wire brush on painted surfaces or it will damage the paint. Once surfaces are scrubbed, wipe them down with a clean cloth so dirty water doesn't dry and stain them. Sweep the floor in bare feet (to test if the floor is completely clean) once you are done scrubbing.

   (b) The bathrooms. Scrub the window pane inside and out with a plastic brush, then wipe excess moisture with a cloth. Scrub bathroom and toilet fixtures: taps, pipes, hoses, soap holders, sink, and toilet. Scrub the inside of the toilet with Harpic and the toilet brush. The sink's tap is easiest to clean with the old toothbrush. After the fixtures, scrub each wall tile one by one from top to bottom. Again you may need to scrub or scratch off paint and other hard stains. "Patiently and persistently" will take you a long way; don't worry about the whole bathroom, just the current tile you are cleaning. Finally, scrub the floor tiles. While scrubbing tiles, continuously remove hair and other debris from the drain and throw it in the dustbin.

   (c) Accessories. If you are feeling especially loving toward future meditators, clean the plastic stools, dustbin/dustpan (from the balcony), buckets, and mugs by scrubbing them and rinsing them.

4. Mop. In bare feet (to ensure floor is completely clean), mop the bedroom. Rinse the bathroom and toilet floors with clean water and squeegee them dry. Close all the windows in the bathroom/toilet/bedroom.

5. Clean window glass. Scrub the outside of each window pane if you haven't done so already. If the window panes are particularly dirty, muddy water will drip down the side of the residence; scrub this off the wall so it does not stain the white paint. Spray Colin on the inside and outside of window glass and wipe the glass clean with newspaper.

You're done!
