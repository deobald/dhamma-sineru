## Dormitories

Each dormitory contains 12 beds, 2 or 3 curtains per bed, fans, light fixtures, 3 windows, and a countertop.

Estimated time required: 2 full days for 4-6 dhamma sevaks

### 1. Sweep up.

If the dining hall is particularly dirty, sweep it up first so dirt doesn't come into the dorms as you move back and forth. Remove miscellaneous items (coat hangers, toothpaste, combs, pencils, laundry clips, wires, boards, garbage, water bottles, etc). Remove stools, then dust and wipe them outside. Sweep the floor.

### 2. Wash curtains.

Gently remove all the curtains from the curtain rods and curtain wires. Snap-dust curtains in a whipping motion outside (see photo) while they are dry to remove dirt. Wash all the curtains by soaking, scrubbing, and rinsing them in a clean residence bathroom. About 8 curtains fit comfortably in one bucket. Hang the curtains to dry in the sun. You will replace them when you replace the linens in the dormitory.

### 3. Move beds to one side.

Pick up all linens (sheets, pillow cases, duvet covers, pillows, duvets, and blankets) and hit them to remove any dust settled on top. Move all the linens to two beds on the far side of the dorm. Vacuum all the remaining mattresses with the upholstry brush. Take each mattress outside to dust it off on all five remaining sides (four edges and bottom). Stack all mattresses on the remaining two beds on the far side of the room.

### 4. Clean half the dorm

In this step, clean six of the twelve beds. If you choose to clean the two beds closest to the linens and piled mattresses, be very careful not to spill dust on them.

   (a) **Sweep.** Sweep from top to bottom: Tops of walls, rafters, fans, walls, windows, wooden wall planks, half-walls, countertops, beds (over and under), floor.

   (b) **Vacuum.** Use the vacuum's blower function first! Vacuum all corners and cracks around wooden bedframes. Blow out all the spaces under the beds and alongside the beds. Sweep up what you can with a broom before using the vacuum to suck up the smaller dust. Sucking up large dust or debris with the vacuum will clog it. Sweep the beds and floor afterward.

   (c) **Dry dust.** Use a dry rag to dry dust: rafters, fans, curtain rods, windows (inside and outside), half-walls, and countertops. Sweep the beds and floor afterward.

   (d) **Wet dust.** Use a damp rag to dust fans and windows (inside and outside). Wipe up any water after wet dusting with a dry rag. Sweep the beds and floor afterward.

   (e) **Clean window glass.** Spray Colin on glass and wipe off with newspaper.

   (f) **Scrub countertops.** Use a plastic brush, green scratchy pad, and wire brush (if needed) to scrub stains and paint splatters off of any exposed tile. Mix a small amount of phenol and water in a mug as a cleaner. Sweep the floor afterward.

### 5. Clean the other half of the dorm

In this step, clean the remaining six beds and the rafters above them. Move all linens and mattresses to the clean half of the dorm and repeat Step 4. The four mattresses with bedding (linens and other mattresses) on them should be vacuumed and dusted outside before moving if they weren't cleaned in Step 3.

### 6. Replace beds and curtains

Put one mattress back on each bedframe. Place one type of linen on each mattress: At the head of the bed, put one pillow with duvet cover, sheet, and pillowcase on it. At the foot of the bed, put one duvet with one blanket on it. Replace all the blue curtains with seams facing toward the bed. Replace all white curtains with seams facing toward the window.

### 7. Sweep & Mop

Sweep the floor one or two times with the normal broom. Sweep the floor with the dry mop -- by this point the floor should be clean enough that it collects almost no dust. Mop the floor. Replace the stools.

You're done! Hooray!
