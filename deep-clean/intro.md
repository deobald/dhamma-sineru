## Introduction

What is "Deep Cleaning" and how is it different from regular cleaning? Daily cleaning is like your daily practice. It removes the dirt created that day, or perhaps a bit more. Deep Cleaning is more serious, like a serious meditation course. In the same way that Anapana and Vipassana lift very deep impurities to the surface, initial deep cleaning will make things dirtier at first because you are lifting up dust, dirt, and stains from places which haven't been touched in a while. Once you are finished, though, the room will be totally free of dirt.

Goenkaji himself occasionally compares Vipassana to cleaning and these comparisons work both ways. When he compares repeatedly sweeping the floor to cleaning up mental impurities, it's possible for an old student to examine this bi-directionaly and to see the value of working this way in daily life as one does in meditation. If you sweep your residence three or four times it will be much cleaner than sweeping it once.

Similarly, Goenkaji compares a new stain on an already-dirty shirt to a new stain on a perfectly clean white shirt. It is only noticable on the clean, white shirt. When the Vipassana centre is completely clean like this, it is very easy for the Dhamma Sevaks to spot a new stain and immediately remove it. The cleaner the centre is, the easier it is to clean!


## General Advice

- Always try to clean top to bottom.
- Always follow the checklist and check tasks as they are completed.
- Always wear a dust mask while sweeping and dry dusting.
- Always be very careful not to harm any visible creatures, no matter how small.

Tasks are organized by area and each area may take a different amount of time/effort. We have tried to estimate how many people can clean each area but it won't always be possible to clean them all. The Administration can keep a log of the most recently deep-cleaned areas. If you can only clean one or two areas, you can enter these in the log so the the cleaning team for the next work period knows that they can deep clean something else. If there is no log, the next team can ask the Administration which area is best for them to clean.

Do not worry if you feel the time is limited or you are unable to finish. Because deep cleaning begins by making a bigger mess than was there to start with, just make sure you choose a small enough task that you can finish it before you leave. Even if only one residence is deep-cleaned in a service period, that one residence is that much better for the next service period.
